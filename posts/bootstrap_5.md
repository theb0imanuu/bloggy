**Bootstrap 5** is the latest major release of the world's most popular front-end CSS framework. It provides a set of tools for building modern, responsive web interfaces quickly and consistently.

Originally developed by Twitter, Bootstrap has evolved into a go-to framework for prototyping and full-scale UI development. With over 160,000 stars on GitHub and powering millions of websites worldwide, Bootstrap has proven its reliability and effectiveness in real-world applications.

## What's New in Bootstrap 5?

Bootstrap 5 represents a significant evolution from its predecessors, introducing several game-changing improvements that modernize the development experience.

1. **No jQuery Dependency**

   - Pure JavaScript for all components
   - Faster and lighter with reduced bundle size
   - Better performance and compatibility with modern frameworks

2. **Improved Grid System**

   - Enhanced with utilities like `.gx-*` and `.gy-*` for precise gutter control
   - New XXL breakpoint (`xxl`) for ultra-wide screens
   - Improved flexbox implementation for better alignment options

3. **Custom Utilities API**

   - Easily extend or override default utilities
   - Generate only what you use to minimize CSS bloat
   - Create custom spacing, colors, and layout utilities

4. **New Components**

## Enhanced Customization and Theming

Bootstrap 5 introduces powerful CSS custom properties (CSS variables) that make theming more flexible than ever. You can now customize colors, spacing, and typography without rebuilding the entire framework. The new color palette includes additional shades and semantic colors, while the updated typography system provides better readability across all devices.

## Code Example

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h1 class="text-primary">Hello, Bootstrap 5!</h1>
      <p class="lead">Built with modern CSS and JavaScript</p>
      <button class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Get Started</button>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">
          <h5 class="card-title">Responsive Design</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Mobile-first approach ensures your site looks great on any device.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
